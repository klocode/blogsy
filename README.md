# README

A Rails API-only application using PostgreSQL as its database to track Users, their Posts, and Comments.

Run bundle to install the basic dependencies.

Run rails db:create to create a database.

And rails db:migrate to run all of the migration files set up.

Run rails db:seed to populate the database tables with data.

Run rake test to run the unit tests for each model and their associations and validations.

When I ran this on my machine, the most prolific user was Narcissa Malfoy with 8 posts.
